# Jenkins v2 Starter

Dockerized setup of Jenkins v2 for local testing of Jenkins build
configurations, and the Jenkins API.

## Docker Setup

*Note:* Docker (w/ docker-compose) must be installed on your system before
using the setup script.

Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:tobinquadros/jenkins2-starter.git && cd jenkins2-starter
```

Run the setup script:

```
./bin/setup
```

You can optionally override the docker-machine "default" hostname:

```
DOCKER_MACHINE_HOSTNAME="dockerhost" ./bin/setup
```

Follow the command line prompt, ensure you have the initial Jenkins admin key
and proceed to the browser.

## Jenkins initial setup

1. Paste in the initial admin key.

2. Choose the plugin install method and your preferred plugins (ensure to install git plugin).

3. Add the admin user with these credentials (the dotenv setup depends on these settings):

  - Username: `user`
  - Password: `password`
  - Fullname: `user`
  - Email: `me@example.com`

## Add jobs to Jenkins

*Note:* You can use this repo for the source repository because it has multiple
branches and a Jenkinsfile for testing out v2 features.

Jenkins has updated [docs](https://jenkins.io/doc/) for the key new features.

1. Create a [pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/) job
2. Create a multibranch-pipeline job

#### Save the jobs you just created

There is a simple script that will copy a job's `config.xml` from the docker
container into a local `job-configs` directory. This makes it easy to play
around with the Jenkins GUI and save your work in source control.

Run the `get-job-config` script, the file will be copied to
`job-configs/${JOB_NAME}/${CONFIG_NAME:-"config.xml"}` (sub-directories are
.gitignored):

Usage:

```
./bin/get-job-config source-job-name [target-filename]
```

## Run the Jenkins API client starter scripts

###### To list all jobs in Jenkins thru the Go client

Ensure your GOPATH is set properly and install the dependencies:

```
go get github.com/bndr/gojenkins
go get github.com/joho/godotenv
```

Run the starter script:

```
go run go-client/list-jobs.go
```

For more info see the [GoJenkins Github
Repo](https://github.com/bndr/gojenkins) or the
[GoDocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/bndr/gojenkins) page.

###### To list all jobs in Jenkins thru the Ruby client

Ensure the bundler gem is installed and install dependencies:

```
gem install bundler # may require sudo
bundle install
```

Run the starter script:

```
./ruby-client/list-jobs.rb
```

For more info see the [JenkinsAPIClient Github
Repo](https://github.com/arangamani/jenkins_api_client) or the
[Docs](http://github.arangamani.net/jenkins_api_client/) page.

## Profit

At this point you are ready to further test Jenkins v2 and the Ruby/Go API
clients!
